# Write a program that takes two integers, a and b, as input.
# Your program should compute and display:
# The sum of a and b
# The difference when b is subtracted from a
# The product of a and b
# The quotient when a is divided by b
# The remainder when a is divided by b
# The result of log10 a
# The result of a^b

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(a,"+",b,"is",a+b)
print(a,"-",b,"is",a-b)
print(a,"*",b,"is",a*b)
print(a,"/",b,"is",a/b)
print(a,"%",b,"is",a%b)
print(a,"^",b,"is",a**b)
